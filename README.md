# Pyrus (Papyrus)

These are some experiments with drawing on a canvas with the touches API that includes pressure information (e.g. Apple Pencil)

## The Idea
- record handwriting for different letters
- create algorithm to create "average" of letters
- let users improve their handwriting by making it more consistent
- show the "average" in the background as a guide
- export the letters as a font
  - with ligratures
